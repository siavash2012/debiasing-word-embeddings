# Debiasing Word Embeddings with Adversarial Learning

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for debiasing word embeddings based on  
**_"Mitigating Unwanted Biases with Adversarial Learning"_** by Brian Hu Zhang *et al.*

## üìÇ Notebooks and Resources

- **`adv_debiasing_glove.ipynb`**  
  Trains an adversarial model for gender debiasing of GloVe 300-dimensional embeddings and evaluates its effectiveness.

- **`Debiasing_Nationality_Bias_GoogleNews_Embeddings.ipynb`**  
  Trains an adversarial model for nationality debiasing of Google News 300-dimensional embeddings and evaluates its effectiveness.

- **`ethics_plot_diff.ipynb`**  
  Trains an adversarial model for gender debiasing of Google News 300-dimensional embeddings and evaluates its effectiveness.

- **`ethics_neural_single.ipynb`**  
  Contains template code for adversarial training of the models.

- **`ethics_plot.ipynb`**  
  Contains template functions for plotting word embeddings.

- **`glove_to_word2vec.ipynb`**  
  Converts GloVe embeddings from `.txt` format to Word2Vec-compatible `.bin` format.

- **`questions-words.txt`**  
  Google Analogy Test Set used for training the models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

To run the notebooks:

1. **Update file paths** in the notebooks to match your local environment.
2. **Download the 300-dimensional word embeddings** (e.g., GloVe or Google News Word2Vec) from either:
   - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
   - [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
